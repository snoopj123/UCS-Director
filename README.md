UCS Director PowerShell Scripts

This repo contains the following scripts:

1) AssociateGlobalServiceProfile.ps1 - A UCS Central PowerTool script that will can be used in a UCS Director workflow to associate a global service profile to either a UCS B-Series blade or a UCS C-Series rackmount server (currently an issue using UCS Director's UCS Central association task to a C-Series)

2) DisassociateGlobalServiceProfile.ps1 - A UCS Central PowerTool script that can be used in a UCS Director workflow to disassociate a global service profile to either a UCS B-Series blade or a UCS C-Series rackmount server (same as #1, issue with UCS C-Series)
